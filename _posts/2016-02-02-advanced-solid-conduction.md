Thermacore's k Technology division offers its k-Core<sup>®</sup> material technologies to satisfy the requirements of the most demanding requirements of aerospace, military and industrial applications. k-Core is a high-performance solid conduction material system that can be tailored to solve a wide variety of thermal challenges. Thermacore’s k Technology division has been providing k-Core based solutions to major aerospace and avionics manufacturers since 1995.

<strong>k-Core Material System</strong>
k Technology’s k-Core products offer up to eight times the conductivity of aluminum at up to a 30% reduction in mass. Typical k-Core products have four times the conductivity of aluminum with a 10% mass reduction. k-Core is cooling some of the world’s most advanced electronics applications, from space systems to undersea naval operations. The products are proven, in wide use, and can replace metal based solutions with little system impact.

CTE-matched k-Core based heat spreaders provide thermal engineers with the ability to attach a thermal solution directly to the heat-producing semiconductor components, enabling higher thermal conductance interfaces such as solder or high-conductance epoxy. Therefore, the benefits of direct CTE matching and the benefits of k-Core are combined.
